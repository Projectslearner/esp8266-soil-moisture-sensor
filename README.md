# ESP8266 Soil Moisture Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to read and interpret data from a soil moisture sensor. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content in the soil, which can be used in applications like automated irrigation systems and gardening projects.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Soil Moisture Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - **VCC Pin:** Connect to the 3.3V output of the ESP8266.
   - **GND Pin:** Connect to the ground (GND) of the ESP8266.
   - **Analog Output Pin (A0):** Connect to the analog input pin (A0) on the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication for debugging.
   - Define the analog pin connected to the soil moisture sensor.
   - Declare a variable to store the sensor value.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the main loop, read the analog value from the soil moisture sensor.
   - Print the sensor value to the Serial Monitor.
   - Determine the soil moisture level (dry, moist, wet) based on the sensor value.
   - Wait for 1 second before taking another reading.

#### Applications
- **Automated Irrigation Systems:** Automatically water plants based on soil moisture levels.
- **Gardening Projects:** Monitor soil moisture to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
- **Educational Projects:** Learn about soil moisture sensing and data interpretation.

#### Notes
- **Calibration:** The threshold values for dry, moist, and wet soil can be calibrated based on your specific sensor and soil conditions.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure the ESP8266 and soil moisture sensor are powered appropriately to get accurate readings.
